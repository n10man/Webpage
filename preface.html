        <h1>Hello and welcome Marija :D</h1>
        <div class="preface-message centered">
            This project started in late May (My birthday to be exact) and was coded all the way until mid June, where I put aside time each morning (The main reason I wake up at 5am everyday is to have my free time where I got to work on this and other parts of the gift in peace :D ). This website was made to show my love and appreciation to Marija, the most beautiful human on earth. While some points might be repetitive, I hope that this this is better than what you initially expected by asking me for letters/a package.  Within this short website is an interactive walkthrough with cale on the second part, as well as a secret vide hidden somwehre which hopefully explains everything that I've been hiding/wanting to say as of the making of the entire project :)
